# Shawzin Simulator

Simulates a Shawzin from Warframe, a video game by Digital Extremes. If you 
want to train your Shawzin skills but don't have the full game at hand, use
this.

## System Requirements

* Windows (64 bit)
* 30 MB of free disc space I guess

## Installation

1. Download the artifact from the latest release.
2. Unzip
3. Open folder
4. Double-click on `shawzin.exe`

When you try to run the Shawzin Simulator on Windows, the file might get blocked by Windows SmartScreen.
To run it anyway, you have to perform these steps:

1. **Right-click** on the downloaded `shawzin.exe` file.
2. Select **Properties**.
3. In the Properties window, under the **General** tab, look for an **Unblock** checkbox near the bottom. If it's present, check it and click **OK**.
4. If you get a Windows SmartScreen warning upon running the file, click on **More info**, and then select **Run anyway**.

## Controls

Press 1, 2, 3 to play the raw strings. Hold Left, Down, or Right when playing a
string for higher notes. Hold space for Whammy to play a semitone deeper.
Press tab to change the scale. Press A to change the instrument.
